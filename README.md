# Final-Goodbye

Hello guys. After logging in into my Telegram account some weeks ago I saw how many messages you sent me! 

I appreciated every single thing I did and for that I thank you. Like all things though, it's time to move on. 

I've been out of the Reverse-Engineering scene for almost a year now, and at the moment, I have no intention of returning. I am dedicating myself to more serious and important projects in my life.

I want to say thank to everyone for the support during this amazing period! Big shotout also to the Reverse-X Discord Server, and all the amazing guys I met here such as Kroks, Snow, Solidify, Radon and Sven (I might have forgotten someone, who knows).

I felt this necessity to make this message to give a small answer to my absence during this period, also considering how many messages I got from you.

Hope I brought joy to you with my tools! ❤️❤️❤️

Much love, Cabbo.

I am still opened to message BUT PLEASE ON DISCORD > @cabbo1337 | @cabboshiba  **I WILL NOT ANSWER ANYMORE ON TELEGRAM, BUT I STILL HOLD THE HANDLE @cabboshiba**

I'll be happy to discuss with you, but I won't take any Reverse Engineering request anymore :))
